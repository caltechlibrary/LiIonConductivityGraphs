## SNAP potential for Ni-Mo binary system

This directory `https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/snap/tree/master/Ni-Mo/training` contains the SNAP force field parameters for Ni-Mo binary system. This potential is fitted from the DFT data, including,
```
- Undistorted ground state structures for Ni, Mo and the two binary intermetallics Ni3Mo and Ni4Mo;
- Distorted structures constructed by applying different strains to a bulk supercell;
- Surface structures of elemental structures;
- DFT calculated molecular dynamics trajectories for bulk supercells;
- Alloy structures constructed by partial substitution of supercells of the bulk fcc Ni with Mo and the bulk bcc Mo with Ni.
```

The hyperparameter tuning and fitting procedures are described in detail in our publication [1] and thus are excluded from the repo.
